# Agents: Marketing Microservice

## required reading

Before implementation, read:

- `README.md`
- `BUSINESS.md`
- `SYSTEM.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `AGENT_OPERATIONS.md`
- `TASKS.md`
- `STATE.json`
- `docs/17_governance/PROJECT_INVARIANTS.md`
- `docs/01_vision/VISION.md`

## authority

Operators and agent workers may act only within the approved project intent, scope boundaries, and validation gates in this repository. Human approval is required for scope changes or production deployment decisions.

## intent preservation system

The project preserves the chain:

`Vision -> Goal Impact -> System -> Feature -> Task -> Execution Plan -> Coding Prompt -> Code -> Validation`

This is the binding requirement for planning, coding, and validation work.

## safety and operations

- Never commit secrets, credentials, or raw production data
- Keep the system grounded in proven repository facts
- Use `[MISSING: ...]` or `[UNKNOWN: ...]` instead of inventing facts
- Keep validation debt separate from current-task failures
- Prefer the narrowest valid validation command before broad test suites

## project-specific rules

- AI must never send campaigns without owner approval
- Unsubscribe requests must be honored within 24 hours
- All delivery must go through notifications-microservice; never send directly
- Max 30 items per request; do not increase timeouts, investigate logs and improve batching instead
- Before any .env change, create a backup and add new variable names (keys only) to .env.example
- Consult docs/agents/master-prompt.md and docs/agents/contracts/*.md before changing campaign, consent, or channel-registry behavior

## required final report

The final task report must include:

- files changed
- documents created or revised
- validation commands and results
- validation debt used or created
- active blockers as `[MISSING: ...]` or `[UNKNOWN: ...]`
- deviations from scope
- next concrete action
